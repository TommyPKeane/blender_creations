# Blender Creations

This is a repository of 3D designs created using Blender 2.83 for static and dynamic designs.

I don't have any academic or professional experience in 3D Graphic Design, but I do have experience multi-dimensional spatio-temporal geometry and calculus.

I am using this repository to log/share 3D models, scenes, sequences, and getting practice with Blender to ultimately investigate adding new mathematical Python-based functionality and features.

Unless otherwise specified in a README file, all designs and images have been created by Tommy P. Keane for personal use, shared here as licensed.
